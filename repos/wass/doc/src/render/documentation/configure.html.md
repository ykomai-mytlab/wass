# Pipeline Configuration

Before using WASS to reconstruct your stereo data, two different components must be configured:

1. WASSjs should be made aware of the location of your data, the number of frames, desired output directory, etc
2. The pipeline executables (especially ```wass_stereo```) should be tuned so that the best possible performance
can be achieved.

This page will help you configure WASSjs. Refer to [Matcher Configuration](/wass/documentation/matcher.html) or
[Stereo Configuration](/wass/documentation/stereo.html) for a guide configuring ```wass_match``` and ```wass_stereo```
respectively.

## WASSjs general configuration

General settings regarding the whole WASS pipeline can be set by editing the file ```<WASS_ROOT>/WASSjs/settings.json```. This
file is loaded once WASSjs is started and should be independent from the specific dataset to be reconstructed.

Here is an example of the default ```settings.json```:

```
{
    "pipeline_dir": "../dist/bin/",
    "prepare_exe": "wass_prepare",
    "matcher_exe": "wass_match",
    "autocalibrate_exe": "wass_autocalibrate",
    "stereo_exe": "wass_stereo",
    "http_port": 3000,
    "num_frames_to_match": 50,
    "prepare_parallel_jobs": 4,
    "match_parallel_jobs": 4,
    "stereo_parallel_jobs": 4
}
```

When editing this file it is important to maintain its structure so that it
respects the [JSON data-interchange format](http://www.json.org).  Just modify
the required values without altering the structure (ie. keep the brakets and so
on) so that it can be properly read by WASSjs.

Here is a short explanation of all the relevant options:

|   key    |     value          |
|---------|--------------------|
| ```pipeline_dir```           |  directory (either absolute or relative) of the pipeline executables  |
| ```prepare_exe```           |  name of the prepare executable (no need to change this)  |
| ```matcher_exe```           |  name of the matcher executable (no need to change this)  |
| ```autocalibrate_exe```           |  name of the autocalibrate executable (no need to change this)  |
| ```stereo_exe```           |  name of the stereo executable (no need to change this)  |
| ```http_port```           |  port used by the internal http server  |
| ```num_frames_to_match```           |  The maximum number of stereo frames to be matched in a sequence. Small number of frames will give a faster but less accurate auto-calibration. Vice-versa |
| ```prepare_parallel_jobs```           | Number of prepare jobs to be run in parallel (set this number to the number of cpu cores of your machine | 
| ```match_parallel_jobs```           | Number of match jobs to be run in parallel (set this number to the number of cpu cores of your machine | 
| ```stereo_parallel_jobs```           | Number of stereo reconstruction jobs to be run in parallel (set this number to the number of cpu cores of your machine | 




## Data-specific configuration

All the setting relative to a specific image set to be reconstructed are contained in the file ```<WASS_ROOT>/WASSjs/worksession.json```.
Once a new stereo sequence is acquired, start by placing all the stereo images in a directory of your choice following the naming convention explained
in the [Getting-started](/wass/documentation/getting_started.html) section (or follow the example set given with WASS_TEST.zip).

Then, edit the file ```<WASS_ROOT>/WASSjs/worksession.json``` to set the correct input/output directories together with the reconstruction
settings. 

The default ```worksession.json``` to be used with the provided WASS_TEST dataset should look like the following:
 

```
{
    "cam0_datadir":"../test/WASS_TEST/W07/input/cam0/",
    "cam1_datadir":"../test/WASS_TEST/W07/input/cam1/",
    "workdir":"../test/output_W07/",
    "confdir":"../test/WASS_TEST/W07/config/",
    "savediskspace":false,
    "keepimages":true,
    "zipoutput":true,
    "match_config_file":"matcher_config.txt",
    "dense_stereo_config_file":"stereo_config.txt",
    "wdir_frames":[],
    "seq_start":0,
    "seq_end":6
}
```

Here is a short explanation of all the relevant options:

|   key    |     value          |
|---------|--------------------|
| ```cam0_datadir```           |  directory (either absolute or relative) containing all the first camera images  |
| ```cam1_datadir```           |  directory (either absolute or relative) containing all the second camera images  |
| ```workdir```           |  output directory  |
| ```confdir```           |  directory (either absolute or relative) containing the calibration and pipeline executables configuration files (See the "Camera intrinsic calibration" section below.  |
| ```savediskspace```           |  ***true***: Save some disk space by removing unnecessary files after the reconstruction. <br /> ***false***: Keep all the temporary files generated by the pipeline. Also, keep the undistorted high-resolution images  | 
| ```keepimages```           |  ***true***: Keep the undistorted high-resolution images (even if ```savediskspace``` is set to ***true***) <br /> ***false***: do nothing. | 
| ```zipoutput```           |  ***true***: Zip each working directory <br /> ***false***: keep the reconstructed output directories as-is. | 
| ```match_config_file```   | ```wass_match``` configuration file name (assumed to be located under ```confdir``` directory) | 
| ```dense_stereo_config_file```   | ```wass_stereo``` configuration file name (assumed to be located under ```confdir``` directory) | 
| ```wdir_frames```   | List of all the working directories. ***Do not edit this option as it will be automatically populated by WASSjs*** |
| ```seq_start```   | Index of the first frame of the stereo sequence |
| ```seq_end```   | Index of the last frame of the stereo sequence |


## Camera intrinsic calibration

WASS can automatically calibrate the reciprocal position and orientation of the
two cameras (usually referred as extrinsic calibration) but assumes the
intrinsic calibration to be known. 

Intrinsic calibration is provided in the form of 4 XML files that must be
placed in the directory ```confdir``` previously specified in the file
```worksession.json```:

|  File  | Description |
|--------|---------------------------| 
| ```intrinsics_00.xml``` |   Intrinsic parameters of the first camera | 
| ```intrinsics_01.xml``` |   Intrinsic parameters of the second camera | 
|```distortion_00.xml``` |   Radial distortion parameters of the first camera |
| ```distortion_01.xml``` |   Radial distortion parameters of the second camera |


The two ```intrinsics_00.xml``` and ```intrinsics_01.xml``` files contain the
standard 3x3 intrinsic camera matrix whereas ```distortion_00.xml``` and
```distortion_01.xml``` contains the 5 parameters of the polynomial radial
distortion model.


To perform the calibration, is highly suggested to use the [Camera Calibration
Toolbox for Matlab](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/)
and follow the described procedure. After the calibration (to be performed
independently for the two cameras), manually copy the values of the Matlab
variable ```KK``` into the ```data``` section of ```intrinsics_00.xml``` (or
```intrinsics_00.xml``` depending on which camera you are calibrating) and the
values of the variable ```kc``` into the ```data``` section of
```distortion_00.xml``` (or ```distortion_01.xml``` for the second camera).

Please refer to the supplied calibration files of the pipeline test for an
example of the XML format used.
